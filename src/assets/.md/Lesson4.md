### Preparing for the Interview

Before your interview, preparation is key. Here’s how you can get ready:

1. **Research the Company**: Understand the company’s mission, values, and what they do. This will show your genuine interest in the position.
2. **Dress Professionally**: Wear clean, well-fitted clothes suitable for the job. Pay attention to grooming, like neat hair, clean nails, and minimal accessories.
3. **Organize Your Certificates**: If the job requires specific certifications, gather and organize them in a folder. Label each certificate and keep them in chronological order.
4. **Prepare Your Answers**: Practice answering common interview questions, such as:
    - Tell me about yourself.
    - Why do you want to work here?
    - What are your strengths and weaknesses?
    - Can you describe a challenging situation at work and how you handled it?
    - How do you handle stress?

### Interview Structure

The interview usually follows a specific structure:

1. **Introduction** – You’ll introduce yourself and share a bit about your background.
2. **Evidence-speaking** – You’ll answer questions, providing evidence of your skills and experience.
3. **Your Questions** – The interviewer will give you a chance to ask questions.

- **Situation** – Describe a situation you faced.
- **Task** – Explain the task or challenge involved.
- **Action** – Share what actions you took to address it.
